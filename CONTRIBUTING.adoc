== Source code contribution ways of working

* For larger contributions create an issue for any required discussion
* Implement solution on a branch in your fork
* Make sure to include issue ID (if created) in commit message, and make the message speak for itself
* Once you're done create a pull request and ask at least one of the maintainers for review
** Remember to title your pull request properly as it is used for release notes

== Run Locally
